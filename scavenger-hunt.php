			<div class="twelve columns alpha">
				In October 2013, I submitted a t-shirt design to a Threadless contest to make a t-shirt for the Chicago Children's Museum. I did a bunch of research about the museum found my imagination running wild with the things you could do there (and mildly jealous that I wasn't a kid in Chicago!). I thought it would be wonderful to have a shirt that represented all the neat things kids could do at the museum.

				My first idea was to perhaps to do a "Family Circus" style map showing a kid walking around the museum. I never did figure out the best way to represent three levels and at over time, I thought that if I had a set path, there should be a reason that for this. This is what lead me to the scavenger hunt idea. It's more open and allowed me to make better use of the space on the shirt.

				It did not win the grand prize, however the museum still wanted to use the design regardless and according to the representative at Threadless, it is now being sold at the museum gift shop. They were too cheap to send me a sample.<br>

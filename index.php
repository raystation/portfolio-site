He becomes comfortable on the Enterprise, repeatedly turning down offers of his own command, and he learns to cherish the company of his fellow officers. Nonetheless, Riker retains a willingness to occasionally disregard the chain of command. Riker is usually referred to as "Will", although in early first-season episodes of TNG he is sometimes called "Bill" by Deanna Troi. He is also usually (and informally) called "Number One" by Captain Picard, because of his position as first officer on the Enterprise.				</p>							<div class="four columns alpha add-bottom">					For the first two seasons, Riker is portrayed as bold and confident, an ambitious young officer; however, over time Riker's character becomes more reserved, as experience teaches him the wisdom of a patient, careful approach. 				</div>								<div class="four columns add-bottom">					For the first two seasons, Riker is portrayed as bold and confident, an ambitious young officer; however, over time Riker's character becomes more reserved, as experience teaches him the wisdom of a patient, careful approach. 				</div>				<div class="four columns omega add-bottom">					For the first two seasons, Riker is portrayed as bold and confident, an ambitious young officer; however, over time Riker's character becomes more reserved, as experience teaches him the wisdom of a patient, careful approach. 				</div>							</div> <!--  END LEFT TWELVE COLUMN  -->						<!-- RIGHT FOUR COLUMN -->			<div class="four columns omega index-right-column">				<h5>Current Projects</h5>				<ul>					<li><a href="indiginauts.php">Indiginauts</a></li>					<li><a href="the3.php">The3</a></li>					<li><a href="gif-fun.php">Daily GIF</a></li>				</ul>				<hr>				<h5>Games Playing</h5>				<ul>					<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ftl-faster-than-light/id833951143?mt=8">FTL</a>, iPad</li>					<li><a href="http://www.naughtydog.com/games/the_last_of_us/">The Last of Us</a>, PS3</li>					<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tiny-thief/id656620224?mt=8">Tiny Thief</a>, iOS</li>					<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zookeeper-battle/id548270497?mt=8">Zookeeper Battle</a>, iOS</li>					<li><a href="http://www.elderscrolls.com/skyrim">Skyrim</a>, PS3</li>				</ul>				<hr>				<h5>Listening to</h5>				<ul>					<li>Grizzly Bear</li>					<li>The Octopus Project</li>					<li>Washed Out</li>				</ul>				<hr>				<h5>Things I want to tattoo on my body</h5>				<ul>					<li>Angel wings on my butt, from when I fell from heaven</li>					<li>USB ports</li>					<li>Barcode for Ecto Cooler</li>					<li>My birthdate in Roman numerals</li>					<li>the one password I use for all my logins so I don't forget</li>				</ul>				<hr>			</div> <!-- END RIGHT FOUR COLUMN -->		</div>		</div> <!-- END CONTAINER -->		<?php include('inc/footer.php'); ?>

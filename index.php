He becomes comfortable on the Enterprise, repeatedly turning down offers of his own command, and he learns to cherish the company of his fellow officers. Nonetheless, Riker retains a willingness to occasionally disregard the chain of command. Riker is usually referred to as "Will", although in early first-season episodes of TNG he is sometimes called "Bill" by Deanna Troi. He is also usually (and informally) called "Number One" by Captain Picard, because of his position as first officer on the Enterprise.				</p>							<div class="four columns alpha add-bottom">					For the first two seasons, Riker is portrayed as bold and confident, an ambitious young officer; however, over time Riker's character becomes more reserved, as experience teaches him the wisdom of a patient, careful approach. 				</div>								<div class="four columns add-bottom">					For the first two seasons, Riker is portrayed as bold and confident, an ambitious young officer; however, over time Riker's character becomes more reserved, as experience teaches him the wisdom of a patient, careful approach. 				</div>				<div class="four columns omega add-bottom">					For the first two seasons, Riker is portrayed as bold and confident, an ambitious young officer; however, over time Riker's character becomes more reserved, as experience teaches him the wisdom of a patient, careful approach. 				</div>							</div> <!--  END LEFT TWELVE COLUMN  -->						<!-- RIGHT FOUR COLUMN -->			<div class="four columns textbox omega" style="padding-right:0px; padding-top:0px;">				<h5>Current Projects</h5>				<ul>					<li>Indiginauts</li>					<li>The3</li>					<li><a href="gif-fun.php">Daily GIF</a></li>				</ul>				<hr>				<h5>Music I am Listening to</h5>				<ul>					<li>Grizzly Bear</li>					<li>The Octopus Project</li>					<li>Washed Out</li>				</ul>				<hr>				<h5>Ringtones</h5>				<ul>					<li>Grizzly Bear</li>					<li>The Octopus Project</li>					<li>Washed Out</li>				</ul>				<hr>				<h5>Games: Currently Playing</h5>				<ul>					<li>FTL, iPad</li>					<li>Skyrim, PS3</li>					<li>Tiny Thief, iOS</li>					<li>Zookeeper, iOS</li>					<li>Disco Zoo, iOS</li>				</ul>				<hr>				<h5>Lifelist</h5>				<ul>					<li>Grizzly Bear</li>					<li>The Octopus Project</li>					<li>Washed Out</li>				</ul>			</div> <!-- END RIGHT FOUR COLUMN -->		</div>		</div> <!-- END CONTAINER -->		<?php include('inc/footer.php'); ?>

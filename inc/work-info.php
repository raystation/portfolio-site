They can create stories that contain their own original ideas while being structurally complete and well-formed.

Looking at tarot cards and comics for inspiration, I sought to break each event down to it's core action. The main characters would all be represented by simple stick-like figures with no faces. Each image was accentuated with one color.

We developed the game as a simplified <span class='tooltip underline' title='Point and Touch?'>point-and-click</span> geared toward mobile devices. The main goal was to take everything we learned from classic point-and-clicks, like <em>Monkey Island</em>, and streamline and simplify.

Exchanging sketches back and forth with the author, we decided that we could have a cast of  characters that could be reused which would greatly speed up the work, as well as establish a visual&nbsp;language.

It was easy and now Malado had something she use call her own and didn’t need to hire web designers to update.

She, like other people, was starting to see the merits of the responsive design, something I didn’t really know existed yet. All this would pave the way to me eventually putting together a <a href="malado-baldwin-wordpress">Wordpress</a> site for her.

		My friend Malado was growing out of her Indexhibit site and needed <em>more</em>. Responsiveness was the main thing she asked for, but not in those exact words since we didn’t know what that was at the time. I believe what she said was “These pictures look fine on the computer but too small on my phone.” When you're schmoozing it up at the gallery, you want to be able to show someone your painting on the fly while they are consuming free wine and cheese. There are sales to be made!
		</p><p>
		Since we're good friends, she always lets me try out the new things I learn on her site so out with the Indexhibit and in with Wordpress!
		</p><p>
		Epilogue: Malado really likes Wordpress, but finds it overwhelming sometimes. Artists are very picky about how their work is shown so she needed complete freedom. She is generally happy with the site but she finds that she doesn’t have the time to maintain it anymore. Recently, I’ve been thinking about building her a super simple site with my newfound PHP, jQuery, media query and SASSSSSS skills...to be continued...?

So I went about helping her figure out the best way to get this going for&nbsp;her.

		After figuring out all the nessesary information on her hosting, the actual Wordpress install really was about 5 minutes (this is something they boast)! We worked together on learning about a fresh WP install and soon was figuring out best practices for theme management, plugins and navigation. PRETTY COOL. So cool that <a href='malado-baldwin-wordpress'>Malado </a> wanted a site just like Sarah’s!

I did a bunch of research about the museum and found my imagination running wild with the activities you could do there (and mildly jealous that I wasn\'t a kid in Chicago!). I thought it would be wonderful to have a shirt that represented all the neat things kids could do at the&nbsp;museum.

		My first idea was to perhaps to do a "Family Circus" style map showing a kid walking around the museum. I never did figure out the best way to represent three levels without a lot of weird perspective glitches. This is what lead me to the scavenger hunt idea. T-shirt real estate wise, it was more forgiving and allowed me more freedom with the  space on the shirt.

		Our first foray into the iPhone games arena was a trivia game. &ldquo;The&nbsp;3&rdquo; centered around the basic concept of multiple choice trivia with timely usage of powerups.
		</p>
		<p>
			In our first iteration, you had to type out the answers, but that wasn\'t working out how we hoped and took way too long. It became more of a fast typing game. In our second iteration, we implemented multiple choice with 5 right and wrong answers and set the game time around 2 minutes. We liked this, but ultimately decided that it seemed like people were reading more than they should be, so we decided to cut down the questions and answers to 3, set the timer at one minute and consciously try to keep the wording for questions minimal if possible. We next implemented a system of power-ups and then for the next month went about procuring and writing good trivia questions.
		</p>
		<p>
			We released the game free in the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-3-great-trivia/id694924959?mt=8" target="_blank">App Store</a> with in-app purchases for new categories as a way to generate revenue. It was also a chance for us to get to know first-hand how the App Store worked and seeing how a game would do with ads and without signifigant marketing dollars put behind it. Currently, it is still in stealth release because we still keep finding <span class="tooltip underline" title="FREAKIN\' google spreadsheet!">mistakes</span> in the questions, but we are hoping to squash all the&nbsp;mistakes.'

		</p><p>
		We went through a few iterations in a 2-D perspective but we ultimately scrapped it because we couldn\'t figure out how to program it on our own. We ulitimately decided to put our money into our original idea, Indiginauts, and hire developers to help with that. We put this on the shelf.
		</p><p>
		After the success of <em>Jet Pack Joyride</em> and <em>Temple Run</em>, my business partner Jeremy once again brought up the idea of doing this game. He made the chameleon bipedal and changed the idea so that he was running through a forest picking up bugs. He needed to change to the color of the bugs to pick them up. We had another artist at this point so we made up a bunch of artwork, but once again, the game wasn\'t how we hoped so we put it back on the shelf.

The second half of the book featured walking tours which would highlight eight areas and provide references to the first half of the book. The historic content was pretty awesome. Gun duels, old taverns in the city (that George Washington went to!), rich capitalists that built the city...it was nice to know more about the city I lived in.

We decided that we wanted to have a different look, but still keep the looks aligned. We worked together to establish some base rules and some standard layouts and with the skeleton of the book created, we went about populating the pages.

		Since this was the first time we worked together, I had to make sure their production files were all up to snuff. The owner had a decent eye for design and some previous production experience with magazines, but the files were a copy-and-paste mess. I showed them how to automate the more menial tasks, like converting folders of images to CMYK, paragraph/character styles and indexing (because humans have better things to do!) They had me pretty involved in the design and photo selection process which I quite enjoyed.
		</p><p>
		<strong>Epilogue</strong>: We worked really well together and this book actually became their best selling book which lead to them doing more in the <em>Chronicles</em> series (which meant more work for me! Yeah!). They eventually asked me to do more in the series, but that took some time. In the meantime, they asked me to layout a <a href="city-style">fashion book</a>.';

		<strong>Exploring Sin City’s High-Stakes History</strong>. The third book I worked on with Museyon. With <a href="chronicles-of-old-new-york"><em>Chronicles of Old New York</em></a> selling very well, they decided to continue this series and asked me to help with 5 more books! Which cities? A few ideas were tossed around, but I had a feeling it was always going to be Vegas, baby. Mafia dons, casinos, Elvis, Liberace, nuclear tests...don\'t pretend like you don\'t want to know about this sort of stuff!
		The look of this series was established, the only thing to do was to refine and respond to any sort of issues with New York\'s print run. I adjusted the margins slightly to adjust for the book\'s gutter. Picked a color palette based on the desert. Optimized the photo sephia process so that all photos would all look more similiar. Picked the best picture of Elvis we could.

			Epilogue: With the amazing cover and content, this is easily my favorite book in the whole series because the stories were so amazing and we had a lot of fun putting it all together. Next up...<a href="chronicles-of-old-boston">Boston</a>.

It was a little hard to adjust to at first, but eventually we got&nbsp;there.

		Chris, the creative director, and I worked closely on this one. I gave him a bunch of ideas, but they were all missing something. Once he found the typeface we ended up using, it quickly came in place. I thought the gothic typeface really captured the feel of the featured ghost-like character and the look of the movie. After that, localizing the rest of the materials was easy.

	As of January 2017, students have rated over 1,605,000+ interests. The more students rate and suggest new interests, the better we can tailor our learning materials and be more real-time and relevant.

		My first big task at NextLesson! We have numerous projects and lessons on the site and each one needed a cover.
		<p></p>
		Before I could hire out people to help with the covers, I needed to make sure I knew what I wanted. Planned in tandem with a redesigned search/browse page, we set about standardizing the displayed information as well as taking the first steps to form a distinctive “look.”
		<p></p>
		We set about making sure all covers had the same information in the same spot. Lesson type on top, logo in the bottom left, and title nice and big; everything else was up to the artist. I oversee a team of designers to make sure covers are created in a timely manner. I’ve created a graphics library that our freelancers use to facilitate faster turnaround.
		<p></p>
		Jump to 2 years and 2,034 covers later. Most of the back-covers are complete and a system is in place for new covers. Please see some of my favorite covers below.

			The ability to convey a point of view and persuade with images is a powerful skill, especially in the courtroom. I believe with my varied experience in many areas, I can help bring impactful images with a simplicity that won't distract from the point being made.

			I have over 10+ years of experience in design and production—mainly in print, but more recently in web. I have an illustration background, while being a bit whimsical, I can assure you can adapted to a more professional style suitable for a courtroom!

			I am expert level in the Illustrator and Photoshop, learned how to use computers on a PC, am familiar with the basic tenets of Flash (it's been a few years since I've actually had to produce anything in it), and very good at making presentations. I can use Powerpoint, but I like to start elsewhere before I move into Powerpoint.

			I have worked in the design field for over 8 years and have a solid traditional print background. I used to work at Pokemon, in a small in-house creative team consisting of 3 people. The experience that would most interest you was our work supporting the publishing department (primarily with strategy guides). We would usually have big a diverse range of design work centered around any major video-game or movie releases, so time and project management was essential. More recently, I've been working with an independent publisher designing and laying out their travel guides.

			I consider myself a very hard-working individual, willing to put in the extra time to see things finished. I have links below to my resume and some selected works. Thanks.

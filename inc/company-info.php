		<p>
			The ability to convey a point of view and persuade with images is a powerful skill, especially in the courtroom. I believe with my varied experience in many areas, I can help bring impactful images with a simplicity that won't distract from the point being made.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have over 10+ years of experience in design and productionâ€”mainly in print, but more recently in web. I have an illustration background, while being a bit whimsical, I can assure you can adapted to a more professional style suitable for a courtroom!
		</p>
		<p>
			I am expert level in the Illustrator and Photoshop, learned how to use computers on a PC, am familiar with the basic tenets of Flash (it's been a few years since I've actually had to produce anything in it), and very good at making presentations. I can use Powerpoint, but I like to start elsewhere before I move into Powerpoint.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am a creative jack of all trades and I think I can help redefine this role! Thanks for reading.

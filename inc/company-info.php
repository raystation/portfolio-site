			With my experience working in print, web, and email, along with 8+ years in design and marketing, I believe I can be a strong candidate for the design position. Another reason I did not want to miss this opportunity is that I have a strong interest in moving into the non-profit sector to impact some positive change—I want to make the world a better place.
		</p>
		<p>
		I have worked in small design departments where we had to manage and create artwork for different sized projects, from <a href=\"darkrai\">movie launches</a> to <a href=\"chronicles-of-old-new-york\">300 page books</a> to large-scale tent graphics for big events. We supported all the internal departments as well as enforced the brand standards. Any project that required more than a 3 person team could handle required us to manage an outside vendor. 
		</p> 
		<p>
		I am highly proficent in the Adobe Creative Suite through working in print/web production. Programming is a bit of a hobby of mine—I am extremely comfortable with HTML/CSS and am actively learning other web technologies, like Javascript/jQuery, PHP and Ruby on Rails. I am also highly skilled in <a href=\"monkey-mo\">drawing</a>.

			Hello! I've been hearing a lot about Twitch in the past few years and with my background in design and my passion for gaming, I think I could be a welcome addition to the team! 
		</p>
		<p>
			When establishing branding, I always thought the best first step is to have someone who understands and likes the brand. Watching <em>League of Legend</em> and <em>GTA5</em> streams are one thing, but the <em>Twitch Plays Pokemon</em> phenomenon really changed the way I view your service and any opportunity to work for you guys couldn't be passed! After that, establishing a \"language\" that people can come to expect day after day is key.

			Hi there! I've saw your job posting and y'all seem like fun people! I am a graphic designer and illustrator who likes to code on the side. With over <a href='resume#history'>8+ years</a> of experience in design and production and a passion for gaming(I saw Wiimotes, N64 controllers and CliffyB in the photos on your site), I think I could be a welcome addition to your team!

		<p>I'm currently at a <a href='suspended-belief-studios'>gaming startup</a> that is winding down. I come from a print-production background, more recently delving into web design/production.

In addition to enforcing the brand standards and guidelines, we worked on a variety of projects including toy packaging, video-game launches, brand standard guides for licensees, strategy guide localization, in-store branding, mini-movie websites...just to name a few. Projects usually all bunched up around video-game/TV/movie launches so good time-management was a must.

		<p>
		I am <a href=\"resume#skills\">highly proficent</a> in <a href='color-chameleon'>Photoshop</a> and <a href='100-principles-of-game-design'>Illustrator</a> as I've been using them for a long time.

			I have worked in the design field for over 8 years and have a solid traditional print background. I used to work at Pokemon, in a small in-house creative team consisting of 3 people. The experience that would most interest you was our work supporting the publishing department (primarily with strategy guides). We would usually have big a diverse range of design work centered around any major video-game or movie releases, so time and project management was essential. More recently, I've been working with an independent publisher designing and laying out their travel guides.

			With my experience working in print, web, and email, along with 8+ years in design and marketing, I believe I can be a strong candidate for the design position. Another reason I did not want to miss this opportunity is that I have a strong interest in moving into the non-profit sector to impact some positive change—I want to make the world a better place.
		</p>
		<p>
		I have worked in small design departments where we had to manage and create artwork for different sized projects, from <a href=\"darkrai\">movie launches</a> to <a href=\"chronicles-of-old-new-york\">300 page books</a> to large-scale tent graphics for big events. We supported all the internal departments as well as enforced the brand standards. Any project that required more than a 3 person team could handle required us to manage an outside vendor. 
		</p> 
		<p>
		I am highly proficent in the Adobe Creative Suite through working in print/web production. Programming is a bit of a hobby of mine—I am extremely comfortable with HTML/CSS and am actively learning other web technologies, like Javascript/jQuery, PHP and Ruby on Rails. I am also highly skilled in <a href=\"monkey-mo\">drawing</a>. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Please let me know if I can provide any other sort of information or if we can set up a meeting. Please find my resume in PDF format below or an online version <a href=\"resume\">here</a>. Thank you!

			I have over <a href=\"resume#history\">8+ years</a> working in design and marketing. I come from a print-production background, more recently delving into web design/production. At The Pok&eacute;mon Company, I worked as part of a small team of three, supporting the various departments with their various needs. We worked on things like toy packaging, video-game launches, strategy guide localization, mini-movie websites...just to name a few. We did this all while maintaining the brand standards passed on from Japan.

			I have worked in the design field for over 8 years and have a solid traditional print background. I used to work at Pokemon, in a small in-house creative team consisting of 3 people. The experience that would most interest you was our work supporting the publishing department (primarily with strategy guides). We would usually have big a diverse range of design work centered around any major video-game or movie releases, so time and project management was essential. More recently, I've been working with an independent publisher designing and laying out their travel guides.

			I consider myself a very hard-working individual, willing to put in the extra time to see things finished. I have links below to my resume and some selected works. Thanks.

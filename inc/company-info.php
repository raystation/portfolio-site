			With my experience working in print, web, and email, along with 8+ years in design and marketing, I believe I can be a strong candidate for the design position. Another reason I did not want to miss this opportunity is that I have a strong interest in moving into the non-profit sector to impact some positive change—I want to make the world a better place.
		</p>
		<p>
		I have worked in small design departments where we had to manage and create artwork for different sized projects, from <a href=\"darkrai\">movie launches</a> to <a href=\"chronicles-of-old-new-york\">300 page books</a> to large-scale tent graphics for big events. We supported all the internal departments as well as enforced the brand standards. Any project that required more than a 3 person team could handle required us to manage an outside vendor. 
		</p> 
		<p>
		I am highly proficent in the Adobe Creative Suite through working in print/web production. Programming is a bit of a hobby of mine—I am extremely comfortable with HTML/CSS and am actively learning other web technologies, like Javascript/jQuery, PHP and Ruby on Rails. I am also highly skilled in <a href=\"monkey-mo\">drawing</a>.

			When establishing branding, I always thought the best first step is to have someone who understands and likes the brand. Watching <em>League of Legend</em> and <em>GTA5</em> streams are one thing, but the <em>Twitch Plays Pokemon</em> phenomenon really changed the way I view your service and any opportunity to work for you guys couldn't be passed! After that, establishing a \"language\" that people can come to expect day after day is key.

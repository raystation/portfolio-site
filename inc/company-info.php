			I have worked in the design field for over 8 years and have a solid traditional print background. I used to work at Pokemon, in a small in-house creative team consisting of 3 people. The experience that would most interest you was our work supporting the publishing department (primarily with strategy guides). We would usually have big a diverse range of design work centered around any major video-game or movie releases, so time and project management was essential. More recently, I've been working with an independent publisher designing and laying out their travel guides.

		Hello! I saw your posting and wanted to get in touch. I am a graphic designer and illustrator with some experience in programming. The work you do sounds interesting—I am looking for a position where I can apply my unique skills and also be at a place where I can affect positive change. 
	</p>
	<p>
	I have over <a href=\"resume#history\">8+ years</a> working in design and marketing (and some <a href='chronicles-of-old-new-york'>publishing</a>). At <em>The Pok&eacute;mon Company</em>, I worked in the creative department as part of a small team of three, supporting the internal departments with their various needs. In addition to enforcing the brand standards and guidelines, we worked on projects like toy packaging, video-game launches, strategy guide localization, <a href='darkrai'>mini-movie websites</a>...just to name a few. When projects were too big to be handled in-house, we managed outside vendors and got things produced in a timely manner. I've selected three pieces for your approval below which I think would be relevant to the conversation.

		I am winding down from my <a href='suspended-belief-studios'>gaming startup</a> with my friend. I am as fascianted by game design as I am with the visuals. While I don't have experience working on a live free-to-play game, hopefully my \"gaming-resume\" will more than make up for that. I play a ton of games (casual, midcore, hardcore) and have evolved with the iOS market into it's current free-to-play phase and have been playing console games since the NES/Sega Master System. I love games!

		Hi! I saw your posting on Craiglist and it sounded interesting! I am a freelance designer with programming experience looking to take on more work and thought I would pass along my info.
	</p><p>
		I have worked in two small in-house creative departments supporting major brands. They were fast-paced and we worked in many different mediums. Coming from a publishing world in New York, I have an extended print production background. It was after coming here that I was able to focus more on UI/UX.
	</p><p>
	Of the matters relating to Wordpress, I have experience setting up and helping friends get the CMS running on their <a href='sarah-walko-wordpress'>sites</a>. I have a working knowledge of PHP and Wordpress components which I am actively learning more of in hopes of building more dynamic feature-rich sites(programming has quickly become a hobby of mine)! Since learning of responsive design, I am dumb-founded how major brands still have sites that still don't responsive to tablets and phones. Needless to say, I have experience with responsive frameworks and can build one from the <a href='abriend-puertas'>ground up</a> if need be. Feel free to take a look at the code of my sites on <a href='http://www.github.com/raystation' target='_blank'>Github</a>.
	</p>

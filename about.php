My professional experience in New York was primarily in print design, but I have a proficent understanding of web technologies. In the past two years I have been learning about CSS, Javascript, jQuery and PHP. </p>				<p>I spent my youth in New Jersey where I drew funny pictures of people's faces at theme parks in the summer. I went to school for Graphic Design in Upstate New York and then moved to New York City after that. I found work at Equinox Fitness Clubs and at The Pokemon Company USA. After meeting a nice girl in New York, I got on a plane and moved to San Francisco.</p>				<p>I now live in Chinatown and can hear cable cars outside my windows<a href="hire-me">.</a></p>  			</div>		</div>			</div> <!-- END CONTAINER  -->	<?php include('inc/footer.php'); ?>

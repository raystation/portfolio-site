<h3>The Student Experience</h3>
<p>
  On the student view, the layout mimics our lesson browse page for consistency. Interest categories buttons, which act as filters, are presented on top with unrated randomized interests on the bottom. To the left we have more filters to break down interests by liked, disliked and subcategories.
  As interests are rated, they disappear and the other interests shift over to replace it.

<p>
  In designing the student side of the experience, we wanted to keep the interests front and center. We know students can be easily distracted and with over 3,373 interests, we took steps to minimize scrolling and page clicking. The idea was to try to keep the screen static as students voted.

  At some point, a student may want to look up something specific or look into their favorite hobbies. This is where our filters come in. We made our different categories readily accessible at the top, anticipating that this is something that the student would do quite often.

<p class='caption'>We implemented a simple system to filter by categories, as well as to show what you've liked and disliked.</p>
<p>
  We put filters in so you can browse by category or by interests you've already liked or disliked.

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>
  As of January 2017, students have rated over 1,605,000+ interests. The more students rate and suggest new interests, the better we can tailor our learning materials and be more real-time and relevant.

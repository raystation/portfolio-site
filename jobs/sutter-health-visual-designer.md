I saw this posting and was hoping to be considered for this role.
I was particularly interested in Narvar because I want to expand on my web development skills.

As you will see from my resume, I have in-house creative experience in branding and marketing. I've worked on small teams in gaming, education, and publishing so I am multi-faceted and have demonstrated abilities to multi-task and prioritize. Coming from the production world, I am very detail-oriented and will put in the time to make sure something is done the "right way" to prevent frustration in the future.

More recently, I was Head of Design at edtech startup NextLesson developing branding, producing artwork for the educational content, helping marketing with lead generation, and working on the user interface. Being the lone designer on staff, I had my hand in many different projects so it was a great learning role for me in terms of managing design contractors.

Additionally, to make myself more versatile, I've been mastering HTML and CSS. I've helped clients and friends build websites and like a good puzzle, it has really been something that I find myself enjoying!

I've linked to some relevant graphic design and website projects that I've worked on below, including branding projects and non-profit websites.

I saw this posting on Linkedin and I would love to be considered for this role! I was very excited to see a job from Yelp—having been to two Designers&Geeks talks at your offices, I know you put an emphasis on great design. I've been working at small companies lately and I'm looking for larger more stable places to allow me to really settle in and grow. I believe that Yelp could be this place!

As you will see from my resume, I have in-house creative experience in branding and marketing. I've worked on small teams in gaming, education, and publishing so I have a wide range of skills and have learned to juggle multiple tasks. Additionally, I have a strong illustration and visual background which means really awesome icons and vector graphics.

Most recently, I was Head of Design at edtech startup NextLesson developing branding, producing artwork for the educational content, helping marketing with lead generation, and working on the user interface.

The Yelp Creative Team is a small group of designers and writers with big ideas. Impromptu brainstorm sessions, animated gifs, and afternoon outings to Philz get our thoughts percolating. We collaborate daily to make work that stands out, but something’s missing from our team — and we’re hoping you’re the final piece to our puzzle.
We’ll know you’re the perfect fit because your portfolio will be overflowing with examples of impeccable design skills. Your creativity will speak for itself, but that shouldn’t stop you from telling us about it in your cover letter. (#humblebrags encouraged.)
The right designer will be an excellent communicator who will create compelling, cohesive content and marketing materials within a growing internal creative department. The ideal candidate will not only have experience designing marketing collateral, but also have a clear understanding of performance / metric based design and is comfortable iterating work for testing. Bonus points for experience in B2B marketing!

I saw this posting on Indeed and I would love to hear more about this role! As a big fan of manga, anime, video games, and martial arts, I was particularly interested in learning that you build GIANT ROBOTS. Wouldn't it be cool if there was a robot that was as fluid as a martial artist?

As you will see from my resume, I have design experience in branding, production, marketing, and web developmentâ€”mostly from working as in-house creative. I believe my experience working at Pok&eacute;mon will translate very nicely here. I worked on a small creative team that supported all internal departments including video game launches, movie/tv launches, marketing tours, licensing artwork and branding, and e-commerce products, to name a few things. Wouldn't it be cool if people had giant robots that assisted them in their daily routine?

More recently, I was Head of Design at edtech startup NextLesson developing branding, producing artwork for the educational content, helping marketing with lead generation, and working on the user interface. Additionally, I trained and managed a small team of designers to create art for the site. Wouldn't it be cool if one giant robot pencil would get the job done of 300 smaller pencils?

I found your open role through Linkedin and wanted to apply because it sounds exactly like what I've been looking for (working with cross-functional teams, being involved with every step in the process, owning every step of the process). Basically, it has a startup feel.

While I do have many years of design experience<span class='tooltip' title='marketing and production'>*</span>, I presently find myself gravitating more to the development side. As a self-taught web coder, I have a very strong interest in finding a place to solidify my web/interactive experience and believe this job would do just that.

For the past two years I’ve been at ed-tech startup NextLesson doing product UI/UX, branding, art production, marketing and illustration. While my primary functions were to assist marketing with lead generation, develop the branding, and to develop the artworks for the content on the site, I quickly asserted myself into user interface and user experience. Working with the project manager and engineers, we developed the look and feel of the site and the educational web applications that followed.

Any opportunities to help write code I took—making clickable prototypes for user-tests and small landing sites. From a UI/UX perspective, I may be a little less experienced, but I've never shied away from challenges and given the opportunities, I have always adapted and excelled.

I saw this posting on Linkedin and I would love to be considered for this role! As you will see from my resume, I have visual design experience in branding, production, and web development—mostly from working as in-house creative.

Most recently, I was Head of Design at edtech startup NextLesson developing branding, producing artwork for the educational content, helping marketing with lead generation, and working on the user interface. Additionally, I trained and managed a small team of designers to create art for the site. This job leveraged my print and production experience

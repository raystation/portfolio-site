The vast majority of knowledge —from theories to stories, facts to opinions, politics to painting, cooking to coding, etymology to raw experience— isn't online. When it is, it's scattered across social networks, buried in forums, languishing on unknown blogs, or hidden behind journal paywalls. Typical Internet users struggle to know what's true, relevant, or useful. Worse: most of them never share their knowledge, knowledge which could help others live better, happier, more fulfilling lives.

Our mission is to create a repository for all human knowledge, and to do that, we have to design a system that rewards people for sharing knowledge, makes discovering relevant knowledge easy, and learns over time what's credible and interesting for each user. It's a complex social systems problem, so holistic product design has always been a critical function at Quora. Design reports directly to the CEO and is deeply involved in product strategy, and we utilize a broader spectrum of skills than do most other companies: from psychology, urban planning, game design, and economics through UI / IxD / UX to typography, and much, much more, a diverse array of approaches and skills —and a diverse team— help us craft a product we intend to be truly global in impact.

Our company culture informs how we structure our design roles. We value care, rigor, self-awareness, candor, and holism, so designers at Quora must be autonomously responsible, pragmatic, falsification-oriented, communicative, and empathetic, and to achieve the level of independence required to drive product, front-end technical skills are required. Quora exists today on the web, mobile, and voice-interaction platforms like Alexa and Google Home, and Product Designers work across all these surfaces and at many depths: taking on projects from features to interactions, ranking to UI, internationalization to moderation systems.

As a Staff Product Designer, your expertise and impact will make you a leader within the design team and the company as a whole. You'll be expected to influence product strategy, design processes and practices, and how other designers approach their projects.

If you're interested in democratizing access to knowledge and are looking for autonomy and impact, we'd love to talk to you.

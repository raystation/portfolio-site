#Supercell
##Graphic Designer

We want our players to love every experience with our game worlds and characters, both when playing our games and in everyday life. The Marketing Art team is responsible for the look and feel of our brands outside of the games themselves. We create loading screens, event designs, merchandising concepts, help guide TV animation, and much, much more. It’s a unique responsibility for a unique team distributed across every Supercell office in the world.

With so many people in so many different places, communication and collaboration is incredibly important, but the most important value is the ability and confidence to experiment. We’re looking for highly skilled artists with really big ideas. You’ll have the freedom to learn, try and do new, innovative things in the industry and collaborate with an incredibly talented team!


###About the role

Do you have an excellent eye for composition, colour, and form? A love for popular culture? Sub-cultures? Are you an ocular fiend obsessing over details that nobody else can see? And maybe you’ve been looking at it so long you’re not sure what you’re looking at anymore? You need help.

OR - you could come and work with like-minded people in our San Francisco based Marketing Art Team. Supercell is currently looking for a full-time Graphic Designer to help us manage and develop creatives for our online marketing space.

You will work closely with the Art Lead, 3D artists, and Art producer as we strive for the highest quality artwork possible. In the creative process we encourage independence, critical thinking, and strong and open communication. Our art teams are small and agile, taking responsibility is a must and a passion for excellence in the details is essential to our success.

We are looking for passionate artists who want to help define and build game brands that will last for decades to come. To do this you’ll be asked to collaborate with our Supercell artists all over the world. This means travelling to Korea, Japan, China, and Finland to learn, teach, communicate, share, and generally make cool stuff happen.

We want to grow, and become a beacon of artistic quality - can you help us get there?

I hope you will consider me for this position, as advertised on Linkedin.

I was particularly interested in seeing a position open at Bio-Rad as I've heard great things from people who work or have worked there. I'm also a bit burned from working at startups and looking for something more steady.

As you will see from my resume, I have more than ten years of experience in branding, production, developing marketing materials, and pre-press from working in-house creative departments. Most recently, I’ve been at edtech startup NextLesson doing branding, art production, marketing, product UI/UX, and illustration.

As Head of Design, I coordinated a small team of freelancers to get artwork produced for the educational content on our site. I ensured design and art were on message and on brand while also communicating essential information needed for sales and usage decisions.

Additionally, in an effort to make myself more versatile, I've been developing coding skills to refine production techiques, better interact with user experience designers and software engineers, and be able to create clickable mockups for user feedback.

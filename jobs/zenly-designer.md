#Zenly
##Brand & Graphic Designer

Heyo! As Zenly’s Brand & Graphic Designer, your objective will be to build one of the world’s most iconic consumer brands.

Inspired by the greatest companies and your own creative flare, your role will be key in creating the visual communication that helps our beloved users (and future ones) embrace our app and our brand. From conceiving our image, to empowering our visibility in the app stores, to designing our organic and paid social media presence, you’ll have the autonomy to form and build Zenly’s persona across all channels.

You’ll combine your marketing, graphic design, & art direction skills to improve our brand awareness and seduce our core target audience: teens. You’ll work closely with our Growth Marketing team in San Francisco and Paris to create visual materials that will help shape and manage our brand equity in both online and offline worlds. You are a creative thinker that can consistently produce innovative material with minimal direction from the team.

If this sounds like you, we’d love to hear from you :)

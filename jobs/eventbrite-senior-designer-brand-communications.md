##Senior Designer - Brand Communications

###THE CHALLENGE
No matter the touchpoint, you will be tasked with creating rich, engaging designs and ensuring a cohesive branded experience for every user. We are constantly evolving the Eventbrite brand, and you will be pivotal in helping to define the visual system that the brand is recognized by.

Our Brand Communication designers have a very strong foundation in traditional graphic design, including print design, branding, and typography. These skills are used to create highly engaging pieces of content for our audience to experience and interact with, and this in turn creates meaningful and long lasting relationships with our users. This is a unique opportunity for a designer to have a big impact on our global marketing presence, help define the visual system of the brand, and have your work shared with millions of users.

###THE TEAM
The Brand Communications team is a tight knit team of designers practicing both traditional and digital design. Our team is responsible for bringing the brand’s visual language to life and creating a deep and meaningful relationship between Eventbrite and it’s users. We ensure that at every touchpoint, whether it be an external marketing campaign or a single website page, users have a delightful and memorable experience with the Eventbrite brand.

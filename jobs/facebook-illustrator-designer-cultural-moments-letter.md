After reading the job description, I believe this job sounds like something I would excel at and really enjoy! I'm formally trained in graphic design, with interests in illustration, web design, front-end development, programming, and animation.

As Head of Design at NextLesson, I enjoyed being able to work in design and art. I developed the standard for our [lesson covers][1] and  produced the characters and templates. I developed the UI and created icons for our Tinder-like [student interest tool][2]. I made [glossary images][3] for our interactive learning platform. I've linked to these projects and a few other illustration&#8209;related ones below.

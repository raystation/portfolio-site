After reading the job description, I believe this job sounds like something I would really excel at and enjoy! I'm formally trained in graphic design, with interests in illustration, web design, front-end development, programming, and animation.

As Head of Design at NextLesson, I really enjoyed being able to work in design and art. I developed the standard for our [lesson covers][1]. I produced characters and templates. I developed the UI and created icons for our Tinder-like [student interest tool][2]. I made [glossary images][3] for our interactive learning platform. I've linked to a few illustration related projects below.

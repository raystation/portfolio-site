I found your role through LinkedIn and was excited to see the position so I wanted to pass along my info. I'm a hybrid print/web guy and I'm looking for a collaborative design department with good people. For the past two years Iâ€™ve been at edtech startup NextLesson doing branding, marketing, art production, illustration and product UI/UX. I assisted Marketing with our sales lead generation, press, product announcements, collateral, and conference artwork.

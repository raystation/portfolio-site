I am sending along my info as this position sounds amazing and right up my alley. I believe my extensive art/design production experience and my work building illustration/design systems would be a valuable asset to your team.

At NextLesson, being an edtech K12 company, our work had to walk a fine lineâ€”professional, but still fun. Breaking that down even further, the artwork style we would use for a 1st Grade lesson cover is different from what would appeal to 9th grade teachers and students. I produced beautiful artwork that ranged from cute to abstract and the supporting template systems so contractors could help. I have a proven record of managing and delivering artwork on time.

I've linked to a few relevant projects below. The first project is the lesson and project [covers][1] I mentioned. I set the visual style of our covers at NextLesson, basing on them grade and subject matter usually. The covers have a uniform style, but still vary enough so they don't look boilerplate.

The second project I'm highlighting is [Storymaps][2], where I illustrated general story concepts that served as story creation tools. I created a mono-color fantasy-like world of generic good guys, villains and magical helpers.

The third project is [Project Animore][3], a game concept that was sadly never conceived. Envisioned during the beginning of the free-to-play era of mobile gaming, this game allowed you to mix animals to create new weirder animals.

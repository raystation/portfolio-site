I saw this posting on Linkedin and I hope you will consider me for this position! As a big fan of manga, anime<span class='tooltip' title='One Piece!!! One Punch Man!! xoxo'>*</span> and video games, I was particularly interested in seeing a role at Crunchyroll.

As you will see from my resume, I have design experience in branding, production, marketing, pre-press, and web development—mostly from working as in-house creative. I believe my experience working at Pok&eacute;mon will translate very nicely here. I worked on a small creative team that supported all internal departments including video game launches, movie/tv launches, marketing tours, licensing artwork and branding, and e-commerce products, to name a few things.

More recently, I’ve been at edtech startup NextLesson developing branding, producing artwork for the educational content, helping marketing with lead generation, and working on the user interface.

I know all the core Adobe CC tools and have a very solid web development background. With my production background, I am very well-organized<span class="tooltip" title="I can't tell you how many to-do lists apps I try out in a year!">*</span> self-starter. I like to encourage friendly working environments and pitch in when people get stressed.

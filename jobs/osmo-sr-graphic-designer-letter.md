I found your open design role through LinkedIn and wanted to apply because this seems like a great position. I am crazy excited about what Osmo is doing because you’re bridging hardware and software together to make education fun and engaging. I’ve worked in both education and gaming and would love to work at a place where I can do both! I love the concept of active/passive learning through play.

It seems to me that one of Osmo’s biggest selling points is delight and wonder. Throughout my career and life, I’ve always wanted to delight and make people laugh. I’ve always tried to incorporate an element of fun into my work. I learned at a very young age that the more people laughed, the more people were willing to engage and “buy” your work<span class='tooltip' title='Once upon a time, I was caricature artist at a theme park'>*</span>. Wonder was something I picked up on working at NextLesson; engaging students to ask questions was a big part of what we were trying to do.

A little about me: I’m sort of a hybrid print/web guy. For the past couple of years I’ve been at edtech startup NextLesson as Head of Design where I worked on branding, visuals, marketing, and product UI/UX. I standardized our <a href='work?project=nextlesson-covers&id=osmo-sr-graphic-designer'>lesson covers</a> system as well as <a href='work?project=nextlesson-characters&id=osmo-sr-graphic-designer'>filled our products with artwork</a>.

Being the lone designer on staff, I had my hand in many different projects so it was a great learning role for me in terms of managing design contractors.

Additionally, to make myself more versatile, I've been mastering HTML and CSS. I've helped clients and friends build websites and like a good puzzle, it has really been something that I find myself enjoying!

I've linked to some relevant graphic design and website projects that I've worked on below, including branding projects and non-profit websites.

I found this role on Linkedin and wanted to pass along my info. I recently just left a little startup and wanted to find something similar, but a little bit larger. Doing a little bit of everything really appealed to me on this job posting and I've opted out of a few jobs because of how "narrow" they sounded.

###What's the URL of your website?
<a href='./?id=expensify-sf-designer'>Rayuen.com</a>. I've always maintained a personal website, but with my recent coding knowledge, I've been able to take this whole thing to new level.</p>

###What's your design history? When did you start, and what have you done between then and now?
NYC, 2004. I started off in design and print production at Equinox Fitness Clubs and then was a in-house designer at <a href='work?project=pokemon&id=expensify-sf-designer'>Pok&eacute;mon</a>. I left there to work in publishing and then moved out here to be with my lady friend.

SF, 2012. With most of my experience in print, I sought expand my experience in web. I most recently worked as the lone creative at an education startup as <a href='work?project=nextlesson&id=expensify-sf-designer'>Head of Design</a> doing branding, art production, illustration, and product UI/UX. Learning to code really has been invaluable when it comes to enhancing production processes and building working mockups.

###What do you want to do with the rest of your life, and how is Expensify a step toward your long-term goals?
Rest of my life? That's a huge question! I've been jumping around a bit, so for now I was just hoping to find a "home" somewhere and the position at Expensify sounds like a fun challengeâ€”a place to work on new things, learn new skills and collaborate with new people.

As for long-term, I'm have a jumble of ideas in my head, so the financial freedom to explore artistic projects<span class='tooltip' title='small projects here and there, nothing Elon Musk style big. Games, website ideas, illustrations, etc.'>\*</span> would be something I'm really interested in. And eventually down the line start the foundation for a family<span class='tooltip' title='SOMEDAY.'>\*</span>.

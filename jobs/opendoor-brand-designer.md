#Opendoor
##Brand Designer

At Opendoor, we’re on a mission to make it simple to buy and sell homes. The traditional process is broken, with an average home taking over 90 days to sell and costing thousands of dollars. We make buying and selling a home stress-free and instant. We’ve built an exceptional team, have raised over $300 million from top-notch investors and are growing fast, buying and selling more than $100 million of homes per month.

We’re seeking a talented, organized and dedicated creative problem solver to create in-house visual assets for our marketing, brand and product teams.

#Expensify
##SF Designer
Your Mission, Should You Choose to Accept:

Expensify prides itself on solving real-world problems with a team of top-notch product experts. We are reinventing the way people look at expense reports by automating not just the expense report, but the entire business trip. Joining our team means you are helping us fight the good fight against expense reports that suck!

###About the Job:
Expensify is looking for a talented and energetic designer to work with us in our San Francisco or Portland office. We’re looking for someone who prides themselves on being a design generalist — someone who has a refined aesthetic style with equally strong curiosities in building marketing campaigns and building software/mobile apps.

On the marketing side of this role, we’re looking for someone who is talented in typography, iconography, illustration, print design, and branding. Some of the marketing responsibilities of this role include designing conference booths, creating collateral to support our Sales and BD teams, designing awesome swag to give to our loyal customer base, and helping plan and art direct our one-of-a-kind conference held on a private island in Bora Bora.
On the product side of this role, we’re looking for someone who loves critically thinking about real user experience problems and has simple, elegant solutions to solve them. Some of the product responsibilities of this role include creating wireframes, designing pixel-perfect mockups, building interactive prototypes, and working side-by-side with engineering to build/code the solutions to the problems you solve.

Could this be you?

We are looking for someone who has a thirst to learn in all spectrums of design, is very self-driven, and has experience in a similar role. As the second designer on the team, the ideal candidate is eager to wear multiple hats, and possesses the collaboration skills to work with the engineering, marketing, and product teams to bring projects from concept to completion.

Our team works hard and gets shit done. Not only will you get to work on challenging and fulfilling projects, you’ll also get to see the world with us for our annual Offshore. In the past we’ve worked in Uruguay, Thailand, Cambodia, Portugal, and Croatia for a month — where will we go in 2018?

###Requirements:

* High level of proficiency in Adobe Creative Suite, Sketch, etc
* High level of proficiency with HTML/CSS/Sass and some JavaScript to make your work come to life
* A strong portfolio with emphasis in the areas of marketing, branding, and product design
* The ability to prioritize multiple tasks across multiple teams and work quickly with fast turnaround times
* Self-driven problem-solver and question-asker with a positive attitude who will gel well with our team
* A thirst to learn and grow outside of your comfort zone
Bonus Points:

* Strong git/command line experience
* Video editing skills including experience with Adobe After Effects
* Photography skills
* Experience with A/B Testing
Next Steps:

Like what you see? Applying is easy, but it takes time. See, while we know you're awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of literally hundreds of other applications we get from everyone else. So this is where we're going to ask our first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so we don't accidentally overlook you? There are probably many ways to do that, but the easiest way is to help us out by answering the following questions:

* What's the URL of your website? If you don't have one, why not?
* What's your design history? When did you start, and what have you done between then and now?
* What do you want to do with the rest of your life, and how is Expensify a step toward your long-term goals?
* How did you hear about us? A job posting? Chalk on a sidewalk? From a friend? Let us know where you saw this opening.

Resume not your thing? That’s great, we don’t really read them anyways! Forward your responses to the questions to jobs@expensify.com. We're excited to hear from you!

###Description
Zendesk is looking to hire a Brand Designer to come join our in-house Creative department in San Francisco.

You will be working on a wide variety of projects, from branding, advertising, web design, and everything in between. Our style is very collaborative and informal so versatility and communication skills are key. You are a Designer with well-rounded design skills, a desire to learn, and a passion for solving problems of all shapes and sizes with thoughtful design.

###Responsibilities:

* Create assets for the Zendesk website
* Concept ideas around the Zendesk brand
* Design and execute Zendesk online advertising
* Design presentations and printed materials

###Requirements:
* 2+ years experience with web design
* Strong color and typographic skills
* Up-to-date with all current design technologies/trends and developments
* Self-starter attitude
* Previous experience running your own design projects on the side is appreciated and respected
* Knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript a plus

###Characteristics We Look For:

MINIMALISM
The mantra at Zendesk, all the way from Finance, Sales, HR, Engineering to Creative is "Beautifully Simple". Our brand, product and website should be that. So the designers we are looking for need to be able to execute a highly reduced, minimalist design style that is still Ã¼ber polished and shows the highest degree of attention to detail.

We are always looking for ways to make the brand clearer and simplify the look and feel of the site - which is a balance as we still want to retain a sense of personality/company culture.

HUMOR
One big differentiator for Zendesk is the fact that we can laugh at ourselves and have a sense of humor.

CONSISTENCY
A lot of the work in our department is about maintaining high standards for the brand and keeping our brand consistently executed.

HONESTY
We constantly challenge our decisions and look at our work with a critical eye - that is to say, we are not looking for someone to just follow orders, we want someone who will speak up when they see things that could be done better/differently.

INNOVATION
Nothing is set in stone. We always look to evolve and grow.

WITH THE PROGRAM
You should be excited and show interest in your craft when it comes to design - someone who actively follows all developments in the world of design/apps.

All applicants MUST supply online work samples or a current portfolio with your resume submission.

Please also include what design communities you are a member of (e.g., Dribbble, Behance, Forrst etc) in your cover letter.

You should be willing to work in San Francisco or relocate if necessary. Relocation assistance is available.

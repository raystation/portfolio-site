I saw this posting on Linkedin and I hope you will consider me for this position. As a gamer, I was particularly interested in seeing a role at Tapjoy. I first saw you guys at GDC a couple of years ago and it looks like you've grown a lot since then!

As you will see from my resume, I have design experience in branding, production, marketing, pre-press, and web development—mostly from working as in-house creative. I'm versatile and have a playful that I think is design style that is perfect for gaming. With my record in production, I have proven that I can keep up with strict time-lines and have only gotten faster with programming skills.

Most recently, I’ve been at edtech startup NextLesson developing branding, producing artwork for the educational content, helping marketing with lead generation, and working on the user interface. In addition, I trained and managed a small team of designers to get assets created for the site.

I've linked below to some of my work at NextLesson, some websites I've built for clients, and marketing work.

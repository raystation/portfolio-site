I was sent this posting from a friend and I would love to be considered for this role! As you will see from my resume, I am an multi-faceted in-house designer with experience in branding, art direction, production, marketing, and web development.

I worked extensively with marketing teams to create collateral, ads, promotional pieces, blogs and email templates while keeping the design and branding consistent. I am super collaborative and have found my drawing background helps generate ideas quickly.

Most recently, I was Head of Design at edtech startup NextLesson developing branding, producing artwork for the educational content, helping marketing with lead generation, and working on the user interface. Additionally, I trained and managed a small team of designers to create art for the site.

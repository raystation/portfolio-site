Elevator up to the amazing 9th floor offices in the usually sunny San Francisco Mission with amazing views of the entire city. If it’s Friday get in before 10am and snag a custom created omelet prepared by our amazing culinary team. Check out the Asana app and see what you have to work on today. If it’s Monday, maybe have a team meeting; if it’s Wednesday, forget meetings because it’s meeting-free. Maybe you start wire framing a new site or come up with a plan to get new users into the product easier. Then the company breaks for lunch served by our amazing culinary team. If it’s your birthday or Asanaversary, you create the menu! After lunch and if it’s a Thursday, we’ll have design critique where both Marketing and Product Designers meet, show and discuss our work. If it’s Friday, we have a company-wide TGIF where each of us goes around the room and shares what we are excited about. Then back to work. Maybe you design cool schwag for recruiting or tweak a responsive HTML email that new users will receive or screen print a poster for an event. The point is you love to design, and are willing to try designing anything that helps Asana deliver its mission.

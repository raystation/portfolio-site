I saw this on your site and I hope you will consider me for this position! I was particularly interested in seeing a position open at Altschool after hearing my coworkers speak very highly of you after an informational meeting (I used to work for NextLesson; currently advise for them). Education is a worthy goal, work I personally find a lot of satisfaction in. I want to help build meaningful and useful products that inform and delight.

As you will see from my resume, I have design experience in branding, production, marketing, pre-press, and web development, mostly from working at in-house creative departments. More recently, I’ve been at edtech startup NextLesson doing branding, art production, marketing, product UI/UX, and illustration. Though my work was concentrated in producing artworks for the content on our site and to assist marketing with lead generation, I quickly asserted myself in product user interface and experience. I found myself gravitating more and more toward UI/UX and making prototypes, which is one of the main reasons I am inquiring about this position.

Additionally, in an effort to make myself more versatile, I've  developed coding skills<span class='tooltip' title='HTML, CSS, JS/JQ, some PHP'>*</span> which I have used to refine production techniques, better interact with user experience designers and software engineers, and to be able to create clickable mockups for user feedback.

#Sr. Product Designer
##AltSchool

San Francisco, CA

AltSchool’s mission is to enable all children to reach their full potential. We are a public benefit corporation and a Certified B Corporation, bringing together a unique partnership of educators, engineers and researchers to create a proprietary learning platform guided by the most comprehensive body of current educational research. AltSchool’s platform is designed to empower schools everywhere to offer personalized, whole-child learning for each student, and to enable teachers to truly understand each child—both deep and wide—so they can develop and deliver a personalized curriculum that helps each child thrive.

Headquartered in San Francisco, AltSchool currently operates a network of eight schools in California and New York, which serve as learning labs for ongoing research and development. Starting fall 2017, that network of schools will expand to include the first cohort of pilot partner schools using the AltSchool platform of products and services. We are backed by many key investors including Founders Fund, Andreessen Horowitz, Mark Zuckerberg & Priscilla Chan’s donor-advised fund at the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, who are committed to help achieve the goal of making the best education, the most accessible.

The Product, Engineering, and Design (PED) team is made up of a group of talented individuals working to craft a 21st century operating system to power the AltSchool personalized learning model. Our suite of software applications and hardware tools must serve four distinct user groups - students, teachers, parents, and the AltSchool Operations team - yet work together as a seamlessly integrated whole. The unique challenges that we face in this endeavor create opportunities to flex your creative and analytical skills on a variety of different products, such as our student activity playlist, teacher workflow dashboard, parent app. A user-driven approach guides our product design strategies, so we encourage members of PED to interact closely with our user-groups in a variety of ways, including regular classroom visits and our PED-Educator Buddy Program.

#ASANA
##Product Designer

On Asana’s design team, we take pride in the craft of building products: coming up with ideas, testing them against our users and our teammates across the company, creating polished design artifacts, and taking a leading role alongside our engineers in making sure our designs are well-implemented and bulletproof. Asana is a company of peers: you’ll work with people who come in every morning to decide what needs to be done to accomplish the goals we’ve all helped define, and then take ownership for the speed of the execution on those goals.

###REQUIREMENTS
* A designer who is strong in all the skills needed to see a project through from concept to implementation. You will work through:
* understanding our users and everything they love and hate about managing work
* interaction design for a complex product
* visual design that will make users smile and keep coming back
* implementation details so that nothing gets left out
* A clear communicator with the ability to talk about your designs in terms of users and to advocate your direction with the product and engineering teams
* Deep intuition for usability, but a willingness to let go of your instincts when proven incorrect
* Experience with an iterative design process: incorporating feedback, launching quickly, and testing hypotheses
* A strong portfolio including nuanced workflows and beautiful visual design applied to web-based or mobile apps
* The ability to hand-code HTML/CSS with ease

###BONUS POINTS
* Enough JavaScript ability to simulate the experience of your design in detail
* Experience conducting usability studies
* Software engineering experience: commit design-related fixes directly into the codebase!
* Interest in tangential fields: typography, fine arts, ethnography, and psychology.

#Eaze
##Senior Graphic Designer
We are looking for a graphic designer who absolutely loves the details in design. If you consider yourself a design nerd, we want you! We need someone who will get excited about ideas and sketch concepts into life. Youâ€™ll need to thrive in the execution phase of design and love every minute of it.

We iterate very quickly at Eaze and we need someone who will not only keep up, but set the pace. There is a fine line here at Eaze in respecting the design process, but also knowing when to bend the rules.

We are looking for 5-7+ years of relevant graphic design experience, brilliant illustration skills, stellar layouts, and an eye for balance.

###You Will:
* Take the Eaze brand (and cannabis industry as a whole) to the next level
* Help build an updated visual language of Eaze including presentation, email, and physical postcard templates
* Create insightful and easy to digest infographics
* Develop a unique illustration style that captures the Eaze brand
* Make integrated marketing campaigns for Eaze and Eaze brand partners that span digital and offline channels
* Drive social media content strategy and creation
* Ensure the Eaze Design Team is staying up-to-date on best practices and evolving with latest design trends
* Support key initiatives across marketing, product, and external brand clients

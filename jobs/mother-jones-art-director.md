##Digital Art Director

Mother Jones, which recently won the Magazine of the Year award from the American Society of Magazine Editors, is looking for a digital art director to push the visual story-telling envelope, improve our UX, and discover new ways to connect with our readers.

You: Live and breathe great design and have a strong foundation in typography, photography, illustration, and usability. And you love journalism, and know that right now is an incredible moment to bring the two together for a big impact. You relish both big-picture brainstorming and hands-on design work. You're a nimble, even-tempered multitasker who enjoys the magic of conjuring great work from a limited budget and staff. You want design that is smart but not prissy, groundbreaking but approachable, eye-opening, not head-scratching.

Us: A reader-supported, nonprofit news organization that publishes a torrent of original reporting each day on our site, in addition to our gorgeous bimonthly print magazine. You will work closely with a talented art, photo and production team and reporters and editors committed to innovation.

With a great team and an Ozzie-winning redesign in place, we look forward to innovating on the reader experience, including the design of marquee stories and engagement projects. You’ll work on everything from fast-turnaround photo illustrations to longer-term premier projects (such as the massive private prison expose we published last year, or our Russia scandal vertical) and a new initiative to incorporate documentary filmmaking and animation into the newsroom workflow.

We’re particularly interested in candidates with UX as well as design chops—and, of course, you’ll bring your expertise to the print product too, helping to ensure that powerful, in-depth reporting shines across all our channels. We’re looking for someone who’ll light our imaginations on fire, but who relishes teamwork in a breaking news environment where the art and design staff are not walled off from the journalists; who is eager to be a part of an organization that is designed for the future, not the past.

This position is based in our San Francisco office; remote is not an option.

Must have:

* Five years of editorial design experience required.

* You should be a wizard with design tools such as Photoshop and Adobe InDesign and Illustrator;

* HTML and CSS and have a solid grounding with UX, A/B testing and user testing. Experience with Wordpress (our CMS), as well as film and animation tools a plus. And, more than ever in these crazy times, the ability to laugh at yourself and others helps.

To apply, please send a résumé and some examples of your recent work, with any context you feel would help us to understand the process through which it was created. Email these materials to jobs (at) motherjones (dot) com with 'Digital Art Director' as the subject line. No calls, please.

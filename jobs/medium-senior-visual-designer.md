#Medium
##Senior Visual Designer

Medium has become a must-write destination for doers and thinkers around the world. We want to create a space where ideas are democratized and the platform rewards quality, not clickbait. We are creator-friendly — in both the economic and intellectual property rights we afford them. We respect user privacy. And we value transparency above all else.

Design is key to all of this. As a team, we work closely with engineers, product managers, product scientists, and support. We also work with, and learn from, each other. We move pixels and make prototypes, but first and foremost we think and we write. We’re never happy with what’s out there, and we know how to channel this into something positive.

We’re building something that never existed before. We face a lot of product challenges: designing a writing experience that balances self-expression with platform consistency; crafting an interaction universe that works for incidental visitors and for power users alike; shaping a space that allows for exchanging ideas and disagreement, but encourages mindfulness and safety.
The company design challenges are as fascinating. How do we move fast but ensure design quality? How do we empower everyone in the company to be a designer? How do we get better at giving and receiving feedback? How can design and engineering work best together? How do we prioritize what’s next when there’s so much to do?

None of these have obvious solutions and we love it this way. Help us solve the unsolvable… and then create frameworks and system to do it better, faster, and with more style next time around.

###Who are you?
You like what Medium The Company and Medium The Product are about. You’ve designed and shipped mobile and web products. You enjoy both craft and deliberate, long-term system thinking. You worked with — maybe led — teams of designers. You are confident, but willing to learn… and teach. You know how, and when, to change your mind. You are self-driven, and don’t mind uncertainty and compromise.

We are designing from Medium offices in San Francisco, but we’re happy to consider people from around the world who are willing to relocate.
